## General Information

Here you will find a dynamic turn indicator and chaser that I implemented as part of the course "Microcomputer Technology" at the university.
The code is heavily documented. The project consists of 8 leds divided in two groups (for the left and right indicator). The mode operation
is controlled by 2 buttons. Pressing each button turns on the indicator for the corresponding direction. Pressing both buttons
turns on the chaser light.
