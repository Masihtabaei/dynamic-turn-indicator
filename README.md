## General Information

Here you will find a dynamic turn indicator and chaser that I implemented as part of the course "Microcomputer Technology" at the university.
The code is heavily documented. I called it **codyn**. "codyn" is a partial blend (Coburg [name of a small city located in Bavaria in Southern Germany] + Dynamic). Feel free to extend/adjust this project so that it meets your goals.

The project consists of 8 leds divided in two groups (for the left and right indicator). The mode operation
is controlled by 2 buttons. Pressing each button turns on the indicator for the corresponding direction. Pressing both buttons
turns on the chaser light.
